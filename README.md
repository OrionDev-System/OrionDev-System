# Hi, I'm Orion 👋

I’m on a journey to become a developer by **learning through projects**.  
Right now, I’m building a modular Discord bot in **Python** and creating custom tools in **GreyScript** for the game *Greyhack*.  

Every commit is a step forward — from writing my first lines of code to building real, working tools.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Learning **Python** step-by-step through a real project
- Understanding how to structure and document code
- Using Git & GitHub for version control
- Building a public **Showcase** repository for possible future employers & teams
- Exploring **GreyScript** by creating tools for the hacking-simulation game *Greyhack*

## 📂 My Repositories
- 🔒 **Private Bot Repository** – Full code, under development
- 🌐 **Public Showcase Repository** – Safe snippets, documentation, screenshots (coming soon)
- 🔒 **GreyScript Tools Repository** – Private collection of utilities & scripts for *Greyhack*,
    documenting my experiments and progress in the language

## 📈 My Learning Journey
I commit regularly to keep my skills growing and my GitHub contribution graph green ✅  
I believe in **learning by doing**, and each project I build is a step toward becoming a stronger developer.

- With **Python**, I’m focusing on automation, APIs, and modular project design.  
- With **GreyScript** (in *Greyhack*), I’m sharpening my problem-solving skills by creating tools and scripts that simulate real-world hacking and system logic.

Both languages challenge me in different ways, and together they help me build a deeper understanding of coding, security concepts, and creative problem solving.
