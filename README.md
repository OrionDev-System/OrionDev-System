# Hi, I'm Orion 👋

I'm currently **learning Python from scratch** by developing my own modular Discord bot.  
This project is my hands-on way to understand coding basics, APIs, and automation.  
I’m documenting my journey from beginner to developer — one commit at a time.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Learning **Python** step-by-step through a real project
- Understanding how to structure and document code
- Using Git & GitHub for version control
- Building a public **Showcase** repository for possible future employers & teams
